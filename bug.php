This code exhibits an uncommon PHP bug related to incorrect handling of array keys when using array_merge().  Specifically, when merging arrays with numeric keys that overlap, the later array's values overwrite the earlier ones, potentially leading to data loss. This is often unexpected because one might assume that numerical keys in array_merge() behave like appending to an array, but instead they overwrite.
